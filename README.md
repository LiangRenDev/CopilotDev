# Copilot Design Repository

This repository contains design documents and implementation guides created with GitHub Copilot assistance.

## Current Contents

### RateLimitingDesign/

Comprehensive documentation for implementing rate limiting in ASP.NET Core applications:

- **ate-limiting-implementation-guide.md** - High-level architecture and design patterns for rate limiting implementation
- **priority-based-rate-limiting-implementation.md** - Detailed C# implementation with middleware, priority detection, and validation
- **ate-limiting-policies-guide.md** - Comparison and analysis of different rate limiting algorithms and policies

#### Key Features Covered:
- Priority-based request handling (High, Medium, Low, Background)
- ASP.NET Core middleware implementation
- JWT-based client identification
- Multiple rate limiting algorithms (Fixed Window, Sliding Window, Token Bucket, etc.)
- Security validation and monitoring
- Performance optimization strategies

## Usage

These documents serve as implementation guides and architectural references for building robust rate limiting solutions in enterprise applications.
